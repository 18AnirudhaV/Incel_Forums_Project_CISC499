## CISC 499 Project: Detecting themes/depression in incel forum posts
We have been given a dataset of incel forum posts with the goal of understanding the themes present in posts in order to build predictive modles for properties of interest such as depression or an intent to carry out an attack. The participants in such forums are more heterogeneous than most other forums and the membership and motivations are not well understood.
